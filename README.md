# React-PDF-Creator


A simple React application built with Vite (or Create React App compatible) that allows users to generate PDF documents directly in the browser using text input. It features an option to include a fixed header image on every page of the generated document. This project utilizes the powerful `@react-pdf/renderer` library.
